    <div class="main-left"><div class="main-text"></div><h2><b>Basic Info</b></h2><br><br><p>When Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies. One day a group pushed him down some
    concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But the
    physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his father, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic
    fantasist.
    
    His father’s impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child, prone to abrupt
    Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission,
    and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive.
    
    At the beginning of 2022—after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million
    cars, and him becoming the richest man on earth—Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. “I need to
    shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my
    life,” he said.
    
    It was a wistful comment, not a New Year’s resolution. Even as he said it, he was secretly buying up shares of Twitter,
    the world’s ultimate playground. Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being bullied on
    the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.
    
    For two years, Isaacson shadowed Musk, attended his meetings, walked his factories with him, and spent hours
    interviewing him, his family, friends, coworkers, and adversaries. The result is the revealing inside story, filled with
    amazing tales of triumphs and turmoil, that addresses the question: are the demons that drive Musk also what it takes to
    drive innovation and progress?</p></div></div>
