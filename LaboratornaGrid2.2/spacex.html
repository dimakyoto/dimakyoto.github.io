      <p>In March 2006 SpaceX made its first Falcon 1 launch, which began successfully but ended prematurely because of a fuel
      leak and fire. By this time, however, the company had already earned millions of dollars in launching orders, many of
      them from the U.S. government. In August of that year SpaceX was a winner of a NASA competition for funds to build and
      demonstrate spacecraft that could potentially service the ISS after the decommissioning of the space shuttle. Falcon 1
      launches that failed to attain Earth orbit followed in March 2007 and August 2008, but in September 2008 SpaceX became
      the first privately owned company to send a liquid-fueled rocket into orbit. Three months later it won a NASA contract
      for servicing the ISS that was worth more than $1 billion.In 2010 SpaceX first launched its Falcon 9, a bigger craft so named for its use of nine engines, and the following year
      it broke ground on a launch site for the Falcon Heavy, a craft the company hoped would be the first to break the
      $1,000-per-pound-to-orbit cost barrier and that might one day be used to transport astronauts into deep space. In
      December 2010 the company reached another milestone, becoming the first commercial company to release a spacecraft—the
      Dragon capsule—into orbit and successfully return it to Earth. Dragon again made history on May 25, 2012, when it became
      the first commercial spacecraft to dock with the ISS, to which it successfully delivered cargo. In August that year,
      SpaceX announced that it had won a contract from NASA to develop a successor to the space shuttle that would transport
      astronauts into space.The Falcon 9 was designed so that its first stage could be reused. In 2015 a Falcon 9 first stage successfully returned
      to Earth near its launch site. Beginning in 2016, SpaceX also began using drone ships for rocket stage landings. A
      rocket stage that had returned to Earth was successfully reused in a 2017 launch. That same year, a Dragon capsule was
      reused on a flight to the ISS. The Falcon Heavy rocket had its first test flight in 2018. Two of the three first stages
      landed successfully; the third hit the water near the drone ship. That Falcon Heavy did not carry a satellite but
      instead placed into orbit around the Sun a Tesla Roadster with a mannequin in a space suit buckled into the driver’s
      seat. The first operational flight of the Falcon Heavy launched on April 11, 2019.</p></div></div>
