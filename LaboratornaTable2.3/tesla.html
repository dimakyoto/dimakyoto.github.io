                    <h2><b>Tesla</b></h2><br><br>
                    <p>Tesla Motors was formed to develop an electric sports car. Eberhard was Tesla’s chief executive officer (CEO) and
                    Tarpenning its chief financial officer (CFO). Funding for the company was obtained from a variety of sources, most
                    notably PayPal cofounder Elon Musk, who contributed more than $30 million to the new venture and served as chairman of
                    the company, beginning in 2004.
                    
                    In 2008 Tesla Motors released its first car, the completely electric Roadster. In company tests, it achieved 245 miles
                    (394 km) on a single charge, a range unprecedented for a production electric car. Additional tests showed that its
                    performance was comparable to that of many gasoline-powered sports cars: the Roadster could accelerate from 0 to 60
                    miles (96 km) per hour in less than four seconds and could reach a top speed of 125 miles (200 km) per hour. The
                    lightweight car body was made of carbon fibre. The Roadster produced no tailpipe emissions, as it did not use an
                    internal-combustion engine. Tesla Motors found that the car attained efficiency ratings that were equivalent to a
                    gasoline mileage of 135 miles per gallon (57 km per litre). The vehicle’s electric motor was powered by lithium-ion
                    cells—often used in laptop-computer batteries—that could be recharged from a standard electrical outlet. Despite a
                    federal tax credit of $7,500 for purchasing an electric vehicle, the Roadster’s cost of $109,000 made it a luxury item.
                    
                    In late 2007 Eberhard resigned as CEO and president of technology and joined the advisory board of the company. It was
                    announced in 2008 that he had left the company, though he remained a shareholder. Tarpenning, who was vice president of
                    electrical engineering, supervising the development of electronic and software systems for the Roadster, also left the
                    company in 2008. Musk took over as CEO. In 2010 Tesla’s initial public offering raised some $226 million.</p>
