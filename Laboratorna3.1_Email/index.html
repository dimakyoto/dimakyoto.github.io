                    <h2>Basic Info</h2><br><br>
                    <p>When Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies. One day a group pushed him down
                        some
                        concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But
                        the
                        physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his father, an engineer, rogue, and
                        charismatic
                        fantasist.
                
                        His father’s impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child, prone to
                        abrupt
                        Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of
                        mission,
                        and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive.
                
                        At the beginning of 2022—after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a
                        million
                        cars, and him becoming the richest man on earth—Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. “I
                        need to
                        shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably
                        most of my
                        life,” he said.
                
                        It was a wistful comment, not a New Year’s resolution. Even as he said it, he was secretly buying up shares of
                        Twitter,
                        the world’s ultimate playground. Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being
                        bullied on
                        the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.
                
                        For two years, Isaacson shadowed Musk, attended his meetings, walked his factories with him, and spent hours
                        interviewing him, his family, friends, coworkers, and adversaries. The result is the revealing inside story,
                        filled with
                        amazing tales of triumphs and turmoil, that addresses the question: are the demons that drive Musk also what it
                        takes to
                        drive innovation and progress?</p>
